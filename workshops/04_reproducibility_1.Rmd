# Introduction

## Aims

The aim of this session is to introduce you to good programming practice and the use of R Markdown for creating reproducible analyses.

## Learning outcomes 

The successful student will be able to:

* Organise and document code effectively.  
* Follow good practice in code styling.  
* Create simple R Markdown documents.  
* Control the behaviour of code chunks.  
 
## Reproducibility is good scientific practice

Analysis workflows should conform to the same practices as lab projects and notebooks: structured and documented pipelines. 

* Is best practice, important in research collaboration and mandatory in many  industry settings.   
* Will likely become mandatory for science publication and funding.  
* Will ultimately make your life much easier.  
* Requires time, diligence and practice.  
* Has ‘impact’.

Reproducibility is a continuum - some is better than none:

* Organise your project (directory structure). See [Workshop 1](01_project_organisation.html).  
* Script **everything**.  
* Organise code into sections.  
* Code formatting and style.  
* Code ‘algorithmically’ / ‘algebraically’.
* Document your code with comments. 
* Modularise your code by writing functions. See [Workshop 1](01_project_organisation.html).  
* Use R Markdown [@markdown1; @markdown2]. See [Workshop 4](04_reproducibility_1.html) and [Workshop 5](05_advanced_rmarkdown.html)  
* Collaboration and Version control: Git and GitHub (not covered in this module but see @Bryan2018-hl). 


Ask yourself:

* Readability - Could future you or others understand what you did and why? Could you repeat?  
* Reproducibility - Could you (or others) recreate everything from data import to results communication?  
* Version control - Could you collaborate on code with others? Could you track code development.  

Two good references are @Wilson2014-ij and @Wilson2017-cp.

## What is R Markdown

Live demonstration.

* Blends narrative text with analysis code and output.  
* code is in 'chunks' and you can control the behaviour of each code chunk.  
* Human readable.  
* YAML ("YAML Ain't Markup Language") header between the `---` gives metadata about the Rmd document and its output.   
* Code chunk options control whether the code and its output end up in your 'knitted' document.  
* comments:  
  * in a code chunk the # is still used for comments,  
  * in the text a comment is written like this <!-- a comment -->,  
  * but use Ctrl+Shift+C,  
* \# in the text indicate headings.

## Make your own R markdown doc

* File | New File | R Markdown.  
* Add a title.  
* Add your name.  
* Delete everything except:  
  * the YAML header between the ---
  * the first code chunk which begins:
  ` ```{r setup, include=FALSE} `

That first code chunk is for setting some **default** code chunk options. 

I often use these:


````
```{r setup, include = FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
```
````
`echo = FALSE` means the code will not be included by default - this is normally what you want in a report.

`include = FALSE` means neither the code nor output will appear.

## Organise code into sections.

Have separate named code chunks for each process: set up, package loading, data import, data tidying (maybe several chunks), different analyses, figures etc.

Naming chunks makes it easier to debug.

After the `setup` chunk, I typically have a chunk for loading all the packages I need. I usually add brief comments explaining why I need them if they aren't packages I use all the time.

````
```{r pkg}`r ''`
library(tidyverse)
```
````
Then the chunk for importing.

````
```{r import}`r ''`
# code and comments for data import

```
````
Then chunks for tidying. These may have names that describe the type of tidying. 

````
```{r tidy}`r ''`
# code and comments

```
````

And so on.

All of these would have the report narative around the chunks of code. The exact organisation depends on the project. I often reorganise my chunks as the analysis develops.

## Code formatting and style.
*"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread. "*
[The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) 

Some keys points:

* be consistent, emulate experienced coders  
* accept *"The only way to write good code is to write tons of shitty code first. Feeling shame about bad code stops you from getting to good code"*   
* use snake_case (not CamelCase, dot.case or kebab-case)  
* use `<-` not `=` for assignment  
* use spacing around most operators and after commas  
* use indentation  
* avoid long lines, break up code blocks with new lines  
* use `"` for quoting text (not `'`) unless the text contains double quotes  
* do use kebab-case in rmarkdown code chunk names  

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Ugly code
names(pigeon)[1]<-"interorbital"; hist(pigeon$interorbital,xlim=c(8,14),main=NULL,xlab="Width (mm)",ylab="Number of pigeons",col="grey")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Well-styled code
names(pigeon)[1] <- "interorbital"
hist(pigeon$interorbital,
     xlim = c(8, 14),
     main = NULL,
     xlab = "Width (mm)",
     ylab = "Number of pigeons",
     col  = "grey")

```

## Code ‘algorithmically’.

Write code which expresses the structure of the problem/solution.

Do not hard code numbers if at all possible to avoid.

```{r}
# bad
sum(3, 5, 6, 7, 8) / 5
(3 - 5.8)^2 + (5 - 5.8)^2 + (6 - 5.8)^2 + (7 - 5.8)^2 + (8 - 5.8)^2
```

```{r}
# good
offspring <- c(3, 5, 6, 7, 8)
mean_offspring <- sum(offspring) / length(offspring)
sum((offspring - mean_offspring)^2)
```


## Document your code with comments.

Much of the description of the project will be in the report text, often in a high-level form. Additional information required to understand the properties of the data and the rationale and  mechanics of the analyses need to be documented in comments.

Use comments extensively. Use comments both to give an overview.

* describe the raw data: provenance, format, size, date of creation / download, ownership / license, variables.
* give an overview of processing for analysis as well as individual comments for each action. 
* give an overview of analysis as well as individual comments for each action.
* give a brief rationale for decisions and assumptions at appropriate places.
* consider a 'start with the comments' approach for planning.

# Exercise
Use the Case study and exercises from the example in Workshop 2: [Tidying data and the tidyverse.](workshops/02_tidying_data.html) to develop a report generated through R Markdown. The data are in [Y101_Y102_Y201_Y202_Y101-5.csv](../data/Y101_Y102_Y201_Y202_Y101-5.csv). 

Do:

* Create a Project and suitable directory structure for the analysis.  
* Follow the good practice in this workshop to organise and document your analysis.  
* Follow the advice in the [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).  
* Save a copy of processed data and any figures.  
* Try to summarise some of the data.
