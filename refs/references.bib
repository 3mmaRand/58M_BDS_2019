  title    = "Tidy Data",
  author   = "Wickham, Hadley",
  abstract = "A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready
              for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make
              data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper
              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data
              tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and
              visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a
              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a
              consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated
              with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.",

  abstract = "Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most
              researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills
              for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses
              can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited
              in how effectively they can work with software and data.
              Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab
              projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps,
              and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers
              new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper
              presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher
              can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational
              skill. These practices, which encompass data management,
              programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects,
              tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide
              variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our
              work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTData analysis, statistical research, and teaching
               statistics have at least one thing in common: these activities
               all produce many files! There are data files, source code,
               figures, tables, prepared reports, and much more. Most of these
               files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be
               shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds.
               Without explicit and structured management, project organization
               can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary
               work and reducing the quality of the final product. This unhappy
               result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from
               the software development world, namely, distributed version
               control. This article describes the use of the version control
               system Git and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data
               scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects
               that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown
               documents. Supplementary materials include an annotated set of
